    "### 1. How do you invoke one notebook from another in Databricks?\n",
    "In Databricks, you can invoke one notebook from another using two primary methods: `%run` and `dbutils.notebook.run()`. Each method has its own use cases and benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using `%run`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Includes another notebook within the current notebook context. This means any variables or functions defined in the called notebook become available in the calling notebook.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Ideal for modularizing code, such as putting supporting functions in a separate notebook.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  %run /path/to/NotebookB\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using `dbutils.notebook.run()`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Runs the specified notebook as a separate job, allowing you to pass parameters and handle return values.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Suitable for building complex workflows and pipelines with dependencies.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  result = dbutils.notebook.run(\"/path/to/NotebookB\", timeout_seconds=60, arguments={\"param1\": \"value1\"})\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "- **%run**: Executes the notebook inline, making all its variables and functions available in the current notebook.\n",
    "- **dbutils.notebook.run()**: Runs the notebook as a separate job, allowing parameter passing and return values, but does not share the execution context.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more details on these methods in the [Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/notebooks/notebook-workflows.html). Let me know if you need more information or have any other questions!"

    "  print(result)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using Widgets\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Widgets allow you to pass parameters between notebooks interactively.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Useful for parameterizing notebooks and sharing variables.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # In NotebookA\n",

    "  input_value = dbutils.widgets.get(\"input\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using External Storage\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Store variables in external storage (e.g., DBFS, S3, Azure Blob Storage) and read them in another notebook.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Suitable for sharing large datasets or variables that need to persist beyond the notebook session.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # In NotebookA\n",
    "  variable_to_share = \"some_value\"\n",
    "  dbutils.fs.put(\"/path/to/shared_variable.txt\", variable_to_share)\n",
    "\n",
    "  # In NotebookB\n",
    "  shared_variable = dbutils.fs.head(\"/path/to/shared_variable.txt\")\n",

    "### 4. Can you explain the process of creating internal and external tables in Databricks?\n",
    "Sure! In Databricks, you can create both internal (managed) and external tables. Here's how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal (Managed) Tables\n",
    "- **Definition**: Internal tables are managed by Databricks. Databricks handles the storage and management of the data.\n",
    "- **Storage Location**: Data is stored in the Databricks-managed storage location.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Suitable for data that you want Databricks to manage entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create an internal table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE internal_table (\n",
    "  id INT,\n",
    "  name STRING,\n",
    "  age INT\n",
    ")\n",
    "USING delta\n",
    "LOCATION '/mnt/delta/internal_table';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "External Tables\n",
    "- **Definition**: External tables are not managed by Databricks. You specify the storage location, and Databricks only manages the metadata.\n",
    "- **Storage Location**: Data is stored in an external storage location, such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or DBFS.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Suitable for data that you want to manage outside of Databricks, or data that is shared across multiple systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create an external table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE external_table (\n",
    "  id INT,\n",
    "  name STRING,\n",
    "  age INT\n",
    ")\n",
    "USING delta\n",
    "LOCATION 's3://my-bucket/external_table';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "1. **Storage Management**:\n",
    "   - **Internal Tables**: Databricks manages the storage.\n",
    "   - **External Tables**: You manage the storage location.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Lifecycle**:\n",
    "   - **Internal Tables**: Data is deleted when the table is dropped.\n",
    "   - **External Tables**: Data remains in the external storage even if the table is dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Cases**:\n",
    "   - **Internal Tables**: Use when you want Databricks to handle storage management.\n",
    "   - **External Tables**: Use when you need to manage storage independently or share data across systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding these differences, you can choose the appropriate table type based on your data management needs. Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions!m"

    "- **Implementation**: Using techniques like salting to handle skewed data.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from pyspark.sql.functions import col, concat, lit\n",
    "  skewed_df = skewed_df.withColumn(\"salt\", (col(\"join_column\") % 10).cast(\"string\"))\n",
    "  skewed_df = skewed_df.withColumn(\"join_column_salted\", concat(col(\"join_column\"), col(\"salt\")))\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Speculative Execution**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To mitigate the impact of straggler tasks by launching speculative copies.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Enabling speculative execution in the Spark configuration.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  spark.conf.set(\"spark.speculation\", \"true\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Tuning Spark Configuration Parameters**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To optimize resource utilization and performance.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Adjusting parameters like `spark.executor.memory`, `spark.executor.cores`, and `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  spark.conf.set(\"spark.executor.memory\", \"4g\")\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. What is a partition in PySpark, and how do you control partitioning for better performance?\n",
    "A **partition** in PySpark is a logical division of data that allows for parallel processing. Each partition is processed independently by a task. To control partitioning for better performance, you can:\n",
    "- **Repartition**: Use `repartition()` to increase or decrease the number of partitions.\n",
    "  ```python\n",

    "5. **Monitoring and Logging**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To identify the root cause of the slow task.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Use Spark's web UI and logs to monitor task execution and identify bottlenecks.\n",
