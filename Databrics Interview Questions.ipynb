    "### 1. How do you invoke one notebook from another in Databricks?\n",
    "In Databricks, you can invoke one notebook from another using two primary methods: `%run` and `dbutils.notebook.run()`. Each method has its own use cases and benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using `%run`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Includes another notebook within the current notebook context. This means any variables or functions defined in the called notebook become available in the calling notebook.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Ideal for modularizing code, such as putting supporting functions in a separate notebook.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  %run /path/to/NotebookB\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using `dbutils.notebook.run()`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Runs the specified notebook as a separate job, allowing you to pass parameters and handle return values.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Suitable for building complex workflows and pipelines with dependencies.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  result = dbutils.notebook.run(\"/path/to/NotebookB\", timeout_seconds=60, arguments={\"param1\": \"value1\"})\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "- **%run**: Executes the notebook inline, making all its variables and functions available in the current notebook.\n",
    "- **dbutils.notebook.run()**: Runs the notebook as a separate job, allowing parameter passing and return values, but does not share the execution context.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more details on these methods in the [Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/notebooks/notebook-workflows.html). Let me know if you need more information or have any other questions!"

    "  print(result)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using Widgets\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Widgets allow you to pass parameters between notebooks interactively.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Useful for parameterizing notebooks and sharing variables.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # In NotebookA\n",

    "  input_value = dbutils.widgets.get(\"input\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using External Storage\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Store variables in external storage (e.g., DBFS, S3, Azure Blob Storage) and read them in another notebook.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Suitable for sharing large datasets or variables that need to persist beyond the notebook session.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # In NotebookA\n",
    "  variable_to_share = \"some_value\"\n",
    "  dbutils.fs.put(\"/path/to/shared_variable.txt\", variable_to_share)\n",
    "\n",
    "  # In NotebookB\n",
    "  shared_variable = dbutils.fs.head(\"/path/to/shared_variable.txt\")\n",
    "  print(shared_variable)\n",

    "### 4. Can you explain the process of creating internal and external tables in Databricks?\n",
    "Sure! In Databricks, you can create both internal (managed) and external tables. Here's how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal (Managed) Tables\n",
    "- **Definition**: Internal tables are managed by Databricks. Databricks handles the storage and management of the data.\n",
    "- **Storage Location**: Data is stored in the Databricks-managed storage location.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Suitable for data that you want Databricks to manage entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create an internal table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE internal_table (\n",
    "  id INT,\n",
    "  name STRING,\n",
    "  age INT\n",
    ")\n",
    "USING delta\n",
    "LOCATION '/mnt/delta/internal_table';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "External Tables\n",
    "- **Definition**: External tables are not managed by Databricks. You specify the storage location, and Databricks only manages the metadata.\n",
    "- **Storage Location**: Data is stored in an external storage location, such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or DBFS.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Suitable for data that you want to manage outside of Databricks, or data that is shared across multiple systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create an external table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE external_table (\n",
    "  id INT,\n",
    "  name STRING,\n",
    "  age INT\n",
    ")\n",
    "USING delta\n",
    "LOCATION 's3://my-bucket/external_table';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "1. **Storage Management**:\n",
    "   - **Internal Tables**: Databricks manages the storage.\n",
    "   - **External Tables**: You manage the storage location.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Lifecycle**:\n",
    "   - **Internal Tables**: Data is deleted when the table is dropped.\n",
    "   - **External Tables**: Data remains in the external storage even if the table is dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Cases**:\n",
    "   - **Internal Tables**: Use when you want Databricks to handle storage management.\n",
    "   - **External Tables**: Use when you need to manage storage independently or share data across systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding these differences, you can choose the appropriate table type based on your data management needs. Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions!m"

    "  from pyspark.sql.functions import col, concat, lit\n",
    "  skewed_df = skewed_df.withColumn(\"salt\", (col(\"join_column\") % 10).cast(\"string\"))\n",
    "  skewed_df = skewed_df.withColumn(\"join_column_salted\", concat(col(\"join_column\"), col(\"salt\")))\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Speculative Execution**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To mitigate the impact of straggler tasks by launching speculative copies.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Enabling speculative execution in the Spark configuration.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  spark.conf.set(\"spark.speculation\", \"true\")\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "### Lets say you are getting your data volume is 100 GB , In your spark you are doing 5 Actions and 3 transformations on the data, explain what goes behind the scene with respect to Stages ,tasks?\n",
    "When processing a 100 GB dataset in Spark with 5 actions and 3 transformations, Spark's execution model involves stages and tasks. Here's a detailed breakdown of what happens behind the scenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformations and Actions\n",
    "- **Transformations**: These are operations that create a new DataFrame or RDD from an existing one. They are lazy, meaning they do not execute immediately. Examples include `map()`, `filter()`, and `groupByKey()`.\n",
    "- **Actions**: These are operations that trigger the execution of the transformations and return a result to the driver program or write data to an external storage system. Examples include `collect()`, `count()`, and `saveAsTextFile()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stages\n",
    "- **Definition**: A stage in Spark is a set of tasks that can be executed in parallel. Stages are determined by wide transformations (e.g., `reduceByKey()`, `join()`) that require shuffling data across the cluster.\n",
    "- **Formation**: When you perform transformations, Spark builds a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of stages. Each stage contains tasks that can be executed without requiring data from other stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks\n",
    "- **Definition**: A task is the smallest unit of work in Spark. Each stage is divided into tasks, where each task is executed on a partition of the data.\n",
    "- **Execution**: Tasks are executed by the executors on the worker nodes. The number of tasks in a stage is equal to the number of partitions in the DataFrame or RDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Scenario\n",
    "Let's break down the scenario with 5 actions and 3 transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Data Loading**:\n",
    "   - Spark reads the 100 GB dataset and partitions it. Let's assume it is partitioned into 1000 partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transformations**:\n",
    "   - **Transformation 1**: `map()` - This is a narrow transformation. Spark applies the `map()` function to each partition independently.\n",
    "   - **Transformation 2**: `filter()` - Another narrow transformation. Spark filters each partition independently.\n",
    "   - **Transformation 3**: `groupByKey()` - This is a wide transformation. Spark needs to shuffle data across the cluster to group records by key. This creates a new stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Actions**:\n",
    "   - **Action 1**: `count()` - Triggers the execution of the transformations. Spark executes the tasks in the stages created by the transformations.\n",
    "   - **Action 2**: `collect()` - Collects the data to the driver. This may involve additional stages if the data needs to be shuffled.\n",
    "   - **Action 3**: `saveAsTextFile()` - Writes the data to an external storage system. This may involve additional stages depending on the transformations applied.\n",
    "   - **Action 4**: `reduce()` - Another action that triggers execution. This may involve shuffling data if it requires aggregation.\n",
    "   - **Action 5**: `take()` - Retrieves a specified number of elements from the DataFrame or RDD. This may involve additional stages if the data needs to be shuffled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution Flow\n",
    "1. **Stage 1**: Executes the `map()` and `filter()` transformations. Each partition is processed independently, resulting in 1000 tasks.\n",
    "2. **Stage 2**: Executes the `groupByKey()` transformation. This involves shuffling data across the cluster, resulting in a new set of partitions and tasks.\n",
    "3. **Stage 3**: Executes the `count()` action. This involves aggregating the results from the previous stages.\n",
    "4. **Stage 4**: Executes the `collect()` action. This involves collecting the data to the driver.\n",
    "5. **Stage 5**: Executes the `saveAsTextFile()` action. This involves writing the data to an external storage system.\n",
    "6. **Stage 6**: Executes the `reduce()` action. This involves shuffling and aggregating the data.\n",
    "7. **Stage 7**: Executes the `take()` action. This involves retrieving a specified number of elements from the DataFrame or RDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the stages and tasks involved in Spark's execution model, you can optimize your Spark applications for better performance and efficiency. Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions!"

    "### Lets say out of 100 task, 99 tasks completed however the last task is taking long hours to finish/complete, how to handle this issue ?1\n",
    "\n",
    "When one task out of many is taking significantly longer to complete, it can be a sign of a \"straggler\" task. Here are some strategies to handle this issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Speculative Execution**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To mitigate the impact of slow tasks by launching speculative copies of the slow tasks on other nodes.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Enable speculative execution in your Spark configuration.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  spark.conf.set(\"spark.speculation\", \"true\")\n",
    "  spark.conf.set(\"spark.speculation.quantile\", \"0.75\")\n",
    "  spark.conf.set(\"spark.speculation.multiplier\", \"1.5\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Skew Handling**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To address data skew, where some partitions have significantly more data than others.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Use techniques like salting to distribute data more evenly across partitions.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from pyspark.sql.functions import col, concat, lit\n",
    "  skewed_df = skewed_df.withColumn(\"salt\", (col(\"join_column\") % 10).cast(\"string\"))\n",
    "  skewed_df = skewed_df.withColumn(\"join_column_salted\", concat(col(\"join_column\"), col(\"salt\")))\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resource Allocation**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To ensure that the task has sufficient resources to complete efficiently.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Increase the executor memory and cores if the task is resource-intensive.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  spark.conf.set(\"spark.executor.memory\", \"4g\")\n",
    "  spark.conf.set(\"spark.executor.cores\", \"4\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Task Repartitioning**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To balance the workload more evenly across tasks.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Repartition the DataFrame or RDD to create more evenly sized partitions.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  df = df.repartition(100)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Monitoring and Logging**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To identify the root cause of the slow task.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Use Spark's web UI and logs to monitor task execution and identify bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Optimizing Transformations**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To reduce the complexity and execution time of transformations.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Optimize the transformations to minimize shuffling and data movement.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  df = df.filter(\"column > value\").select(\"column1\", \"column2\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these strategies, you can handle slow tasks more effectively and ensure that your Spark jobs complete in a timely manner. Let me know if you need more details or have any other questions!"
